# Isharah: A Large-Scale Dataset for Continuous Saudi Sign Language Recognition and Translation  

The **Isharah dataset** is a large-scale benchmark designed to advance research in **Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)** and **Sign Language Translation (SLT)**, focusing on **Saudi Sign Language (SSL)**.  

Isharah provides gloss-level and Arabic textual annotations, enabling work in both recognition and translation. The dataset is structured into multiple subsets for scalable experimentation.
